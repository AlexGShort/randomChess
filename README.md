# randomChess
An application to randomly choose an active chess piece, also keeping track of captured pieces.
Uses jquery and jquery UI for animated transitions.

Purpose: to facilitate the game of "random chess" where one player can only move a randomly selected piece while his 9-year-old opponent can strategically counter with any action she deems appropriate.  It's a great way to spend a Sunday evening.
